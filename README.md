- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Manvita Karuturi <br>

Greetings! <br><br>
I'm currently a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems at Northeastern University in Boston. <br>
Before my current academic pursuit, I served as a Network Engineer at Barclays, where I honed my skills and gained valuable insights into the intricacies of networking.<br>

My educational foundation includes a Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the prestigious National Institute of Technology (NIT) Jaipur in India.<br>

This diverse educational background equips me with a comprehensive understanding of both theoretical concepts and real-world applications. <br>
I'm enthusiastic about leveraging this unique blend of experiences to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic and ever-evolving field of Information Systems. <br>
Let's embark on this exciting journey of learning and innovation!
